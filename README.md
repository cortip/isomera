# ISOMERA: The Ultimate Javascript/Typescript SaaS Boilerplate Monorepo for Modern Developers

Unlock the future of seamless SaaS development with ISOMERA, the
all-encompassing Javascript/Typescript starter boilerplate monorepo. Designed
for visionary developers, ISOMERA streamlines the creation of enterprise-grade
applications by providing a robust, modular, and scalable foundation. Whether
you're kickstarting a project with React, Next, Nest, or diving deep into
TypeORM, Redux, and Material UI, our platform is your ticket to efficiency.
Beyond a mere boilerplate, ISOMERA offers comprehensive documentation, training
materials, and a community-driven approach. Contribute to the revolution, join a
community of like-minded developers, and redefine the standards of SaaS
development.

Every developer understands the journey: starting with basic functionalities
and, over time, integrating advanced features like 2FA, role management, or
intricate middleware logic. At the outset, it might seem manageable, but as your
project scales and evolves, these additions can accumulate into months of
development time. Not to mention the effort spent ensuring earlier work
seamlessly integrates with new features. With ISOMERA, this narrative changes.
While not every feature on our ToDo list is immediate, our roadmap is designed
with foresight. As your project matures, ISOMERA grows with you, offering
advanced functionalities just when you need them. It's not just about the
initial boost; it's about the cumulative time and effort saved over the life of
your project. Dive straight into innovation, knowing the foundational and
advanced are already taken care of.

## Developing locally

### Getting started

#### Environment preparation

You will need to install `docker` and `make` into your machine to be able to
work on this project. All other dependencies are managed via Docker util images
and ran via Make commands.

#### Using commands

You can use main commands the way you were used to, just with few small changes.
Since Make considers flags as it's own flags, not arguments being passed, you'd
need to add `--` before flags. For example `make npm -- -v`. Otherwise it would
give you version of make.

##### Adding node packages

```
make yarn add some-package
```

##### Using NX

```
make nx <whatever you need>
```

##### Using Node

```
make node index.js
```

If you need some other console tool, please modify `Makefile` and add
installation of it to the node utils image at `docker/utils/node.dockerfile`.
Consistency is important.

### Running Tests

This is pretty simple, just

```
make nx run-many -- -t test
```

```
make nx run-many -- -t e2e
```

### Running services

#### Run API locally

This will launch API service on port 8080:

```
make nx serve-api
```

This will launch platform on port 4200:

```
make nx serve-platform
```

This will launch landing on port 3030:

```
make nx serve-landing
```
