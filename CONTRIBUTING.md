# Contributors' Guide for Isomera

---

<span color="red" style="color:red;">

##### Main rule:

#### If you show no activity in 3 days on the issue assigned to you, it will be unassigned or reassigned to someone else. Make sure your contribution doesn't go in vane and be active! Since it's not a full-time job, we understand that there might be any kind of circumstances delaying delivery, so it is enough to post a comment mentioning when you're planning to finish. This does not apply for paid frellancers or contractors working on issues.

## Getting started

If you would like to become an Isomera contributor, the first step is to read this document in its entirety. The second step is to review the [README guidelines here](https://github.com/cortip/isomera/blob/main/README.md) to understand our coding philosophy and for a general overview of the code repository (i.e. how to run the app locally, testing, storage, our app philosophy, etc). Please read both documents before asking questions, as they may be covered within the documentation.

## Discord channels

All contributors should be a member of a shared Discord channel called #general -- this channel is used to ask general questions, facilitate discussions, and make feature requests.

Before requesting an invite to Discord please ensure your Upwork account is active, since we only pay via Upwork (see below). To request an invite to Slack, email contributors@isomera.com with the subject Discord Channel Invites. We'll send you an invite! Or you can make it much faster and just click this link https://discord.gg/T3CBgm8yPT .

Note: Do not send direct messages to the Isomera team in Discord or Isomera Chat, they will not be able to respond.

Note: if you are hired for an Upwork job and have any job-specific questions, please ask in the GitHub issue or pull request. This will ensure that the person addressing your question has as much context as possible.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Isomera Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cortip/isomera/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to contributors@isomera.com.

## Restrictions

At this time, we are not hiring contractors in Crimea, North Korea, Russia, Iran, Cuba, or Syria.

## Payment for Contributions

> Please note, that normally we invite to contribute enthusiasts for free, but also, sometimes to make things move faster we take some paid help from Upwork. This section does not mean that all contributions are paid.

> Important: we are building a website to showcase Isomera contributor profiles. Contributors who contributed as contractors (hired) will not be listed there.

We hire and pay external contributors via Upwork.com. If you'd like to be paid for contributing, please create an Upwork account, apply for an [available job in GitHub](https://github.com/cortip/isomera/labels/help%20wanted), and finally apply for the job in Upwork once your proposal gets selected in GitHub. Please make sure your Upwork profile is fully verified before applying, otherwise, you run the risk of not being paid. If you think your compensation should be increased for a specific job, you can request a reevaluation by commenting on the GitHub issue where the Upwork job was posted.

Payment for your contributions will be made no less than 7 days after the pull request is deployed to production to allow for regression testing. If you have not received payment after 8 days of the PR being deployed to production, and there are no regressions, please add a comment to the issue mentioning the vygandas team member.

New contributors are limited to working on one job at a time, however experienced contributors may work on numerous jobs simultaneously.

Please be aware that compensation for any support in solving an issue is provided entirely at Isomera’s discretion. Personal time or resources applied towards investigating a proposal will not guarantee compensation. Compensation is only guaranteed to those who propose a solution and get hired for that job. We understand there may be cases where a selected proposal may take inspiration from a previous proposal. Unfortunately, it’s not possible for us to evaluate every individual case and we have no process that can efficiently do so. Issues with higher rewards come with higher risk factors so try to keep things civil and make the best proposal you can. Once again, any information provided may not necessarily lead to you getting hired for that issue or compensated in any way.

Important: Payment amounts are variable, dependent on if there are any regressions. Your PR will be reviewed by a Contributor+ (C+) team member and an internal engineer. All tests must pass and all code must pass lint checks before a merge.

### Regressions

If a PR causes a regression at any point within the regression period (starting when the code is merged and ending 168 hours (that's 7 days) after being deployed to production):

- payments will be issued 7 days after all regressions are fixed (ie: deployed to production)
- a 50% penalty will be applied to the Contributor and Contributor+ for each regression on an issue

The 168 hours (aka 7 days) will be measured by calculating the time between when the PR is merged.
